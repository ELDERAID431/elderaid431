1. Executive Summary
ElderAid is a mobile application designed to alleviate the challenges faced by elderly individuals in their daily lives while fostering social solidarity. The app enables elderly users to easily communicate their needs (such as shopping, cleaning, walking, or companionship) to young volunteers. By utilizing Firebase infrastructure, ElderAid securely stores user data.
The application supports two primary user types:
•	Elderly Users: These users create help requests, receive offers from volunteers, and select the most suitable option.
•	Volunteers: These users view help requests from elderly individuals, submit offers, and contribute to society by addressing their needs.
Problems Addressed
1.	Difficulty Communicating Help Requests:
Elderly individuals often face challenges in resolving daily issues (such as grocery shopping, pharmacy needs, or loneliness) through traditional methods. ElderAid provides a seamless mobile platform to address these challenges.
2.	Lack of Social Solidarity:
By connecting volunteers and elderly individuals on the same platform, the app strengthens social cohesion and encourages active participation from younger generations.
3.	Insecurity and Communication Gaps:
With Firebase infrastructure, the app ensures secure user data storage and facilitates transparent communication between users. Every help request and volunteer offer is recorded for easy monitoring and accountability.
4.	Limited Access to Modern Technology:
The app’s modern interface, designed with Jetpack Compose, offers a simple and intuitive experience, ensuring ease of use even for elderly individuals.
5.	Emergency Assistance Access:
The SOS button within the app allows users to send out an emergency alert effortlessly when needed.

4. Design and Architecture
●	UI/UX Design:
The design prioritizes accessibility and simplicity. Prototypes and wireframes emphasize large buttons, readable fonts, and straightforward navigation tailored for elderly users.
●	System Architecture:
The application adopts the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to ensure sustainability and scalability. Firebase serves as the backend, providing user authentication, real-time data storage, and cloud hosting for media files.
